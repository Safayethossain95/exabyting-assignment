How do you create react app?

1. Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.


2. Create a new React application: Once create-react-app is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to create your React application using the command-line interface. Then run the following command to create a new React application:

npx create-react-app my-app

Replace "my-app" with the desired name of your application. This command will create a new directory with the specified name and set up a basic React application structure inside it.

3. Navigate to the application directory: After the command completes, navigate into the application directory by running the following command:

cd my-app

Replace "my-app" with the name of your application if you used a different name.

How to run the application

1. Start the development server: To run the React application locally, use the following command:

npm start

This will start the development server and open your application in a web browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

That's it! You have successfully created a React application using create-react-app and started the development server. You can now begin building your React components and writing your application logic.
